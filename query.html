      <ul class="dropdown-menu">
        <li>Psychological	testing	refers	to	the	battery	of	tests	administered	to	evaluate	the	intellectual,	learning,	
            emotional	and/or	behavioral	functioning	of	children	ages	4-17.	<br>Children	are	typically	referred	for	an	
            assessment	by	their	parents,	pediatrician,	therapist	or	school	for	evaluation.	<br>	Psychological	testing	helps	
            parents	better	understand	their	child’s	unique	needs,	strengths	and	weaknesses,	and	provide	information	
            about	diagnosis.<br>	In	addition,	as	many	research	studies	indicated,	early	detection	of	underlying	issues	can	lead	
            to	better	outcomes in	terms	of	intervention	and	treatment.</li></ul>

        <li>Testing	can	help	the	parent,	child’s	teachers,	therapist	and	others	who	are	helping	the	child	guide	him/her	in	
            the	right	direction.	Psychological	testing	is	also	used	to	answer	questions	about	diagnosis	or	functioning	or	to	
            help	solve	problems.	Often	when	problems	with	children	are	evident,	psychological	testing	can	refine	and	
            clarify	what	problem	should	be	worked	on	first	and	with	what	emphasis.	Additionally,	if	there	is	a	problem, the	
            evaluation	helps	both	parents	and	teachers	know	how	to	best	help	the	child.	Psychological	testing	is	also	
            helpful	when	parents	and	teachers	disagree	on	what	the	problem	is.	An	independent	evaluation	answers	
            questions	and	gives	parents	perhaps	new	directions	to	pursue	in	the	child’s	development.</li></ul>

      <span class="caret"></span></button>
      <ul class="dropdown-menu">
        <li>Except in the rare instance where a proctor directly observes and "catches" a test taker cheating, the techniques used to detect cheating are not directly behavioral.<br> 
            Instead, cheating is determined and operationalized in terms of inferences that are made from test scores using a form of statistical detection.
            <br>Another method is to use items that are relatively easy and have been exposed, released, or inappropriately obtained with a small feature changed and the correct answer changed.</li></ul>
